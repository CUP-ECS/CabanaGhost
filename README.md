# CabanaGhost
Regular Mesh Communciation/Computation Benchmark in Cabana to explore application-level primitives for stream- and kernel-triggered communication in combination with hierarchical parallelism. Initial example is a 2D game of life benchmark, but a 3D jacobi iteration benchmark is also in development.
